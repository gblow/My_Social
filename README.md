# Overview

The My Social is a Node.js application programming interface (API) designed for CRUD operations on social networking data models using a NoSQL database. These data models encompass friends, users, thoughts, and reaction data, accessible either by ID or collectively. Developed with Node.js and Mongoose, this API offers a straightforward and scalable approach to managing social networking data, free from the constraints typically associated with traditional relational databases.
